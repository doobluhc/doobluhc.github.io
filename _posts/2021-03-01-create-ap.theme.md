## An Investigation of Visual Question Answering
In teams of four, implemented two models from the literature of VQA: iBOWIMG and Deeper LSTM Q + norm and the results of the two models were reproduced. Investigated methods to improve the models. We incorporateed self-attention layers into the two models and we found that adding the self-attention layers lead to these models overfitting the datasets which decreased the performance. The code for this project is available [here](https://github.com/mlej8/VQA). I was mainly in charge of model implementation and data preprocessing.


## Tech
All the programming is done in Python. In particular, we used Pytorch and Pytorch Lightning.
