## Barber Shop Management System
In this project, in teams of 6,  we built a desktop application for a barber shop. The Barber Shop Management System will allow customers and shop owners to manage their accounts, make appointments and etc. Details of the functionalities and the code repo can be found [here](https://github.com/F2020-ECSE223/ecse223-group-project-p14). This was the course project for ECSE 223: Model-based Programming at McGill and we won the best demo prize in Fall 2020.

## Duties
* Identified the system requirements and domain modeled the project using Umple prior to implementation in Java.
* Followed the Model-View-Controller(MVC) design pattern. Utilized Gherkin scenarios as acceptance test suites.
* Implemented the persistance layer using Java Object Streams.
* Developed the web frontend using Java Swing. Integrated the web frontend with the backend controllers.

## Tech
