# Professional Experiences
## Graduate Research Assistant (2023/05 ~ Present)
  * University of Toronto
    * Developed custom PyTorch kernels to achieve ~10% lossless compression of DNN weights, including Resnet18 and Resnet50.
    * Currently optimizing DNN inference by compressing activations to reduce time and memory usage.
## Research Assistant (2022/05 ~ Present)
  * [Reel FX](https://www.reelfx.com/)
    * Achieved an 80% classification accuracy and a 0.72 regression R2 score in predicting rendering times.
    * Implemented Stable Diffusion for generating animation images and style transfer.
    * Enhancing video rendering efficiency through computing cluster scheduling.

## Research Intern (2021/05 ~ 2022/04)
  * [McGill Edge Intelligence Lab](http://meil.ece.mcgill.ca/)
    * Awarded [Summer Undergraduate Research In Engineering award](https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/students/undergraduate/research)
    * Implemented Knowledge Distillation and Neural Architecture Search to compress BERT models.
    * Developed a blockwise method reducing parameter size by 10X with only a 3% reduction in performance.
    * Pipelined BERT inference on heterogeneous resources. Work published at the Journal of Signal Processing Systems

## Technical Program Manager(2021/04 ~ 2022/04)
  * [McGill AI society](https://www.mcgillai.com/)
    * Organize ten-week long bootcamps that teach lower year undergraduates machine learning fundamentals
    * Act as teaching assiant for the bootcamp: design interview questions, design and grade assignments, hold office hours to answer questions from the bootcamp participants and give workshops on machine learning topics.
    * Gave a workshop on Python for data science to 40+ participants


## Research Intern(2020/05 ~ 2020/09)
  * McGill University
    * Awarded [Summer Undergraduate Research In Engineering award](https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/students/undergraduate/research) and [IVADO Undergraduate Research Scholarship](https://ivado.ca/en/scholarships-and-grants/undergraduate-introduction-to-research-scholarships/)
    * Worked on a research project about Thompson sampling and adaptive control with [Prof. Aditya Mahajan](http://www.ece.mcgill.ca/~amahaj1/) at McGill University
    * Built a simulation testbed for evaluating regret bounds for LQR models.
    * Conducted a detailed evaluation of regret of Thompson sampling and adaptive control under different parametric assumptions.
