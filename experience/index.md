# Professional Experiences
## Machine Learning Intern (2022/05 ~ 2022/09)
  * [Reel FX](https://www.reelfx.com/)
    * Collected, cleaned and feature engineered data from the rendering farm
    * Fine tune machine learning models to predict the rendering time of each render job

## Research Intern (2021/05 ~ 2022/04)
  * [McGill Edge Intelligence Lab](http://meil.ece.mcgill.ca/)
    * Awarded [Summer Undergraduate Research In Engineering award](https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/students/undergraduate/research)
    * Literature review and investigate methods to compress BERT-like models without a compromise in performance
    * Generated results that have a parameter size 10X less than SOTA models with only 5% reduction in performance compared to SOTA models 
    * Still in Progress
    * supervisor: [Prof. Warren Gross](https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/warren-gross)


## Technical Program Manager(2021/04 ~ 2022/04)
  * [McGill AI society](https://www.mcgillai.com/)
    * Organize ten-week long bootcamps that teach lower year undergraduates machine learning fundamentals
    * Act as teaching assiant for the bootcamp: design interview questions, design and grade assignments, hold office hours to answer questions from the bootcamp participants and give workshops on machine learning topics.
    * Gave a workshop on Python for data science to 40+ participants


## Research Intern(2020/05 ~ 2020/09)
  * McGill University
    * Awarded [Summer Undergraduate Research In Engineering award](https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/students/undergraduate/research) and [IVADO Undergraduate Research Scholarship](https://ivado.ca/en/scholarships-and-grants/undergraduate-introduction-to-research-scholarships/)
    * Worked on a research project about Thompson sampling and adaptive control with [Prof. Aditya Mahajan](http://www.ece.mcgill.ca/~amahaj1/) at McGill University
    * Built a simulation testbed for evaluating regret bounds for LQR models.
    * Conducted a detailed evaluation of regret of Thompson sampling and adaptive control under different parametric assumptions.
