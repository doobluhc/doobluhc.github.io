# About Me
I am a student at McGill University currently pursuing Bechelor of Engineering majoring in **Honours Electrical Engineering** and minoring in **Software Engineering**. I am very interested in the field of artificial intelligence and software engineering. I am currently interested in neural networks compression and deep learning acceleration. During my time at McGill, I have done courseswork in **software engineering, machine learning, deep learning, control systems, multi-agent systems, computer architecture**, and more. By working on several machine learning projects, I built a strong theoretical and practical foundation in machine learning. I was awarded the [Summer Undergraduate Research In Engineering award](https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/students/undergraduate/research) and the [IVADO Undergraduate Research Scholarship](https://ivado.ca/en/scholarships-and-grants/undergraduate-introduction-to-research-scholarships/) in summer 2020 to work with [Prof. Aditya Mahajan](http://www.ece.mcgill.ca/~amahaj1/) on Thompson sampling and adaptive control. In Summer 2021, I was awarded the [Summer Undergraduate Research In Engineering award](https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/students/undergraduate/research) to work with [Prof. Warren Gross](https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/warren-gross) on deep learning acceleration at the [McGill Edge Intelligence Lab](http://meil.ece.mcgill.ca/) (MEIL). I am currently working on my honours undergraduate thesis at MEIL, which is about partitioning Transformer based models across heterogeneous resources.
