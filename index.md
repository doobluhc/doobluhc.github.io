# About Me
I am a student at McGill University currently pursuing Bechelor of Engineering majoring in **Honours Electrical Engineering** and minoring in **Software Engineering**. I am very interested in the field of artificial intelligence. In particular, I am interested in neural networks compression and deep learning acceleration. During my time at McGill, I have done coursesworks in **sofware engineering, machine learning, deep learning, control system, multi-agent systems, computer architecture** and etc. By working on several machine learning projects, I built a strong theoretical and practical foundation in machine learning. I also gained extensive research experiences by working on two research projects in the field of artificial intelligence.
